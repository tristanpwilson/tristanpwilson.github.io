              <p>I'm published in multiple academic journals and professional magazines, and have presented at major conferences (e.g, UXPA, UXDC). I'm versed in front-end web development, UX / web design, computer hardware and electronics, and 3D modeling.</p>

              <p>As a Senior UX Researcher at Amazon, I conduct a range of user research activities aimed at informing, refining, and enhancing the usability of the internal tools, software, and systems used by our employees. In particular, my work focuses on A to Z, our one-stop-shop employee app / website actively used by millions of Amazonians every day.</p>
              <p>I'm the lead UX researcher for A to Z Assistant (Aza), our internal gen AI agentic assistant, and have been deeply involved in the design and development of the product since its initial ideation in 2022. I played a critical role in our team's shift toward integrating generative AI into our products, and have conducted 30+ research studies focused on the UX of gen AI experiences and conversational UIs.</p>
              <p>I also lead user research for A to Z core experiences, including the A to Z Home page, A to Z Search, navigation, notifications, our gen AI Digest feature, and more.</p>
              <p>My research runs the gambit of Amazon's employee populations, from corporate ICs and managers, to operations managers and hourly associates. I conduct studies remotely, and travel around the world visiting fulfillment centers to speak with ops employees in person.</p>

              <a href="http://www.aboutamazon.com/" target="_blank" class="link-external"><h4>Amazon<img src="img/external.svg" alt="external link"></h4></a>
              <p>As a user experience researcher (UXR) at Amazon, I conduct a range of research activities aimed at refining and enhancing the usability of the internal tools, software, and systems used by our 1 million + employees. My work spans the entire product lifecycle, from generative user research aimed at identifying deep insights and opportunities, all the way through to evaluative research focused on refining and validating designs. I employ a variety of methods to develop a nuanced understanding of our users including interviews, surveys, concept testing, card sorting, usability testing, tree testing, personas, and journey mapping.</p>
              <p>I'm deeply involved in the iterative design process, collaborating closely with designers, product managers, and developers to translate research findings into actionable design decisions, ensuring that we deliver the most intuitive and effective user experiences possible.</p>
              <p>At a broader level, I contribute to the evolution of Amazon's UX research practices by developing internal research frameworks and educating design and product team members about basic research methods. For instance, I regularly travel to various Amazon ops facilities across the US and abroad to conduct on-site research with employees, and I've developed this into a widely-used program that facilitates and formalizes this process across my organization.</p>

              <!--<a href="http://www.userworks.com" target="_blank" class="link-external"><h4>UserWorks, Inc.<img src="img/external.svg" alt="external link"></h4></a>-->
              <p>At UserWorks, I designed, ran, and managed user research projects at every stage of the lifecycle, from inception, to budgeting, testing, analysis, and reporting. I performed a wide range of user research activities, including usability evaluation, user experience testing, interface design, wireframing, prototyping, heuristic evaluation, contextual inquiry, user journey mapping, persona development, and survey administration. I was UserWorks' lead accessibility specialist, having carried out 50+ accessibility evaluation and remediation efforts on websites, software, and documents.</p>
              <p>My work dealt with a range of products, including websites, desktop software, mobile apps, consumer device hardware, services/experiences, and user documentation. Most recently, my research focused on the evaluation of new medical devices (cardiac monitors, ophthalmologic scanners, etc.) seeking FDA approval, a process that then involved a number of human factors and usability engineering requirements.</p>
              <p>As a Senior-level UX Specialist, I played a significant role in business development and client relations in both the public and private sector. I trained new employees, and managed a team of 3-5 UX specialists on a daily basis.</p>

              <p>I started as an intern at UserWorks, and steadily worked my way up through the ranks to Staff-level, then Project-level UX Specialist. Having come from a background in experimental / clinical psychology, I felt right at home with the user research methods we employed at the company. This allowed me to focus on absorbing as much as I could about the field from the team highly experienced researchers and designers at UserWorks. Even as a relative newcomer, I was taasked with carrying out a variety of user research and design activities on an assortment of products for clients from all manner of industries.</p>
